  <P>
  I am a research scientist at Google DeepMind in London.  
 I am generally interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and, more generally, 
    Artificial Intelligence. My long term endeavor is to enable machines to learn more efficiently and with less supervision by transferring and acrruing knowledge over time.

  I am originally from Padova in Italy, where I graduated in Electronics Engineering. 
  After spending several months at Caltech to work on my thesis, 
  in 2004 I started a Ph.D. in Computer Science at New York University with Yann LeCun. 
  I graduated in 2009 and joined Geoffrey Hinton's lab as a postdoc. 
  In 2011, I moved to industry and was one of the very early members of the Google Brain team in Mountain View CA. 
  In 2013, I joined Facebook and was a founding member of the Facebook AI Research lab. I have been at Google DeepMind in London since August 2021, where I lead the continual learning team.

  I have served as progream chair for ICLR in 2017 and 2018, and NeurIPS in 2020. I have served as general chair for NeurIPS in 2021. I have also co-organized several workshops at major machine learning and computer vision conferences.
